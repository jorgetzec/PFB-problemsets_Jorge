Ricky by Shel Silverstein

Ricky loves me,
Ricky cares,
Ricky picks me peaches and pears.
Ricky offers me candy and Cokes,
Ricky listens and laughs at me jokes.
Ricky helps when I get in a fight,
Ricky does all my homework at night.
Ricky misses me,
Ricky cries,
Ricky thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Ricky is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Ricky just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Ricky's hand,
In the darkness where Ricky usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Ricky's gone!
