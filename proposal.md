# Genome Bacteria Assembly

3 strains from different clades: cynobacteria, actinobacteria, and firmicutes.

Main tasks:
>> Get the sequencing file (fastq)
>> long read assembly
>> polishing the assembly
>> genome annotation
>> comparison of genes annotation 
>> Identification of similarities and differences in gene content
>> Select a family (ATP synthase) commun between the strains.
>> Generate a phylogenetic analysis of commun family of genes.
